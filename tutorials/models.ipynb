In this tutorial, we will learn the basics of using the `nn.Module` class in PyTorch with prebuilt and custom layers.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the tutorial on models in PyTorch! In this tutorial, we will learn how to create models in PyTorch using the `nn.Module` class. We will also learn how to use prebuilt layers and create custom layers. The specific aim of this tutorial is the explain the models used in the accompanying manuscript, which can be found in the `models/` directory of this repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models in PyTorch are a convenient way to package together a neural network architecture. The `nn.Module` class is the base class for all models in PyTorch. It provides a convenient way to define the forward pass of a neural network, which is the process of passing input data through the network to get an output. The `nn.Module` class also provides a way to define the parameters of the network, which are the weights and biases that are learned during training.\n",

    "### Importing libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, let's import the necessary libraries. We will be using the `torch` and `torch.nn` modules from PyTorch."
